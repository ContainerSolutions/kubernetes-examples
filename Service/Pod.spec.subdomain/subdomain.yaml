# Taken from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-hostname-and-subdomain-fields
# Currently when a pod is created, its hostname is the Pod's metadata.name value.
# The Pod spec has an optional hostname field, which can be used to specify the Pod's hostname.
# When specified, it takes precedence over the Pod's name to be the hostname of the pod.
# For example, given a Pod with hostname set to "my-host", the Pod will have its hostname set to "my-host".
# The Pod spec also has an optional subdomain field which can be used to specify its subdomain.
# For example, a Pod with hostname set to "foo", and subdomain set to "bar", in namespace
# "default", will have the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) "foo.bar.default.svc.cluster-domain.example".
#
# If there exists a headless service in the same namespace as the pod and with the same name as the subdomain,
# the cluster's DNS Server also returns an A or AAAA record for the Pod's fully qualified hostname.
# For example, given a Pod with the hostname set to "subdomain-simple-hostname-1" and the subdomain
# set to "subdomain-simple-subdomain-service", and a headless Service named "subdomain-simple-subdomain-service"
# in the same namespace, the pod will see its own FQDN as
# "subdomain-simple-hostname-1.subdomain-simple-subdomain-service.default.svc.cluster-domain.example".
# DNS serves an A or AAAA record at that name, pointing to the Pod's IP.
# Both pods "subdomain-simple-pod-1" and "subdomain-simple-pod-2" can have their distinct A or AAAA records.
